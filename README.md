# Video Game Recommendation

Content-Based recommendation models are used to provide recommendations based on some set of characteristics about a particular input. In this case, if a user has a particular video game that they enjoy, the model will examine certain details about the game, and try to find other games that display similar characteristics.

## Implementation

In this project, the content based recommendation model utilizes cosine similarity to determine the similarity between video games, then displays the 10 most similar games to the input. There are 2 different outputs in this project, one where the model includes reviews of the video games and one without reviews.

## Dataset

This project uses the "Popular Video Games 1980 - 2023" dataset from Kaggle
